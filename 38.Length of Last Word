URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/description/

Question:-
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        # Strip trailing spaces and split the string into words
        words = s.strip().split()
        
        # Check if there are no words
        if not words:
            return 0
        
        # Return the length of the last word
        return len(words[-1])

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
s = "Hello World   "
print(solution.lengthOfLastWord(s))  # Output: 5
