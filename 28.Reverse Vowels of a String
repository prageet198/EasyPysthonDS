TITLE:-Reverse Vowels of a String
URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/description/

Question:-
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def reverseVowels(self, s):
        # Step 1: Define vowels
        vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'  # All vowels in both cases
        
        # Step 2: Create a list to hold the vowels found in the string
        found_vowels = []
        
        # Step 3: Collect all vowels from the string
        for char in s:
            if char in vowels:
                found_vowels.append(char)  # Add the vowel to the list
        
        # Step 4: Reverse the list of found vowels
        found_vowels.reverse()
        
        # Step 5: Create a list to build the result string
        result = []
        vowel_index = 0  # To track the position of vowels in the reversed list
        
        # Step 6: Rebuild the string with reversed vowels
        for char in s:
            if char in vowels:
                result.append(found_vowels[vowel_index])  # Add the next reversed vowel
                vowel_index += 1  # Move to the next vowel in the reversed list
            else:
                result.append(char)  # Add the consonant as is
        
        # Step 7: Join the result list into a string and return it
        return ''.join(result)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.reverseVowels("IceCreAm"))  # Output: "AceCreIm"
print(solution.reverseVowels("leetcode"))   # Output: "leotcede"
