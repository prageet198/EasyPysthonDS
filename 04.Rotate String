TITLE:-Rotate String
URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/description/

Question:-
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def rotateString(self, s, goal):
        # Check if the lengths are different
        if len(s) != len(goal):
            return False  # They can't match if they have different lengths

        # Create a new string by doubling s
        doubled_s = s + s

        # Check if goal is in the doubled string
        return goal in doubled_s

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
s = "abcde"
goal = "cdeab"

# Test the method
result = solution.rotateString(s, goal)
print(result)  # Output: True
