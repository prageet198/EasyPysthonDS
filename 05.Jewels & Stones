TITLE:-Jewels & Stones
URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/description/

Question:-
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels, stones):
        count = 0  # Start a counter for jewels

        # Check each stone in the stones string
        for stone in stones:
            # If the stone is in the jewels string, it's a jewel
            if stone in jewels:
                count += 1  # Increase the count by 1

        return count  # Return the total count of jewels

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.numJewelsInStones("aA", "aAAbbbb"))  # Output: 3
print(solution.numJewelsInStones("z", "ZZ"))        # Output: 0
