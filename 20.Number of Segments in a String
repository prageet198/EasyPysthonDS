URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-segments-in-a-string/description/

Question:-
Given a string s, return the number of segments in the string.

A segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
Explanation: The five segments are ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "Hello"
Output: 1

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def countSegments(self, s):
        # Split the string by spaces and filter out empty segments
        segments = s.split()
        return len(segments)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.countSegments("Hello, my name is John"))  # Output: 5
print(solution.countSegments("Hello"))                     # Output: 1
