TITLE:-Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/description/

Question:-
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        # Use str.find() to get the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack
        return haystack.find(needle)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
haystack1 = "sadbutsad"
needle1 = "sad"
print(solution.strStr(haystack1, needle1))  # Output: 0

haystack2 = "leetcode"
needle2 = "leeto"
print(solution.strStr(haystack2, needle2))  # Output: -1
