TITLE:-Reverse String II
URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/

Question:-
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse 
the first k characters and leave the other as original.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        result = ""  # Start with an empty result string
        n = len(s)   # Get the length of the string

        # Loop through the string in chunks of 2k
        for i in range(0, n, 2 * k):
            # Get the first k characters to reverse
            part_to_reverse = s[i:i + k]
            reversed_part = part_to_reverse[::-1]  # Reverse those k characters

            # Get the next k characters (if there are any)
            part_to_keep = s[i + k:i + 2 * k]  # This takes the next k characters

            # Combine the reversed part and the part to keep
            result += reversed_part + part_to_keep

        return result  # Return the final modified string

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.reverseStr("abcdefg", 2))  # Output: "bacdfeg"
print(solution.reverseStr("abcd", 2))     # Output: "bacd"
