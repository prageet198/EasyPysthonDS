TITLE:-Is Subsequence
URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/

Question:-
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing 
the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        # Pointer for s
        s_index = 0

        # Loop through each character in t
        for char in t:
            # If the current character matches the current character in s
            if s_index < len(s) and char == s[s_index]:
                s_index += 1

        # If we've matched all characters in s, return True
        return s_index == len(s)

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.isSubsequence("abc", "ahbgdc"))  # Output: True
print(solution.isSubsequence("axc", "ahbgdc"))  # Output: False
