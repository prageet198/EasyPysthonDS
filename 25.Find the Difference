TITLE:-Find the Difference
URL:-https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/description/

Question:-
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

Solution:-
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        for char in t:
            if t.count(char) > s.count(char):
                return char

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
s1 = "abcd"
t1 = "abcde"
print(solution.findTheDifference(s1, t1))  # Output: "e"

s2 = ""
t2 = "y"
print(solution.findTheDifference(s2, t2))  # Output: "y"
